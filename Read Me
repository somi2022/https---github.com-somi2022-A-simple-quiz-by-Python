# https---github.com-somi2022-A-simple-quiz-by-Python
In this project I use Python for answering 4 questions.
First I provide an if / else for continuing or quiting the quiz
Then if the player wants to continue by answering the question "yes", the game continues.
If the player answers right then the player get a Correct! otherwise Incorrect!
Finaly I add a scoring system based on procent.
The last line indicates right answer in precentage.
